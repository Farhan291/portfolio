title: About
---
Hi, I’m Farhan, a computer science student at RIT Bangalore. My interests lie in low-level programming, computer networks, and algorithm design and optimization.


My current workflow runs on Fedora with Hyprland as the window compositor. I primarily use Neovim as my main IDE, along with the Kitty terminal, Fish shell, and tmux. I’m also a big fan of the Zen Browser.

In my free time, I enjoy watching anime and listening mostly to East Asian music, such as J-pop, K-pop, and C-pop. I also like playing visual novels.

I’m always open to conversations, ideas, and collaborations.
