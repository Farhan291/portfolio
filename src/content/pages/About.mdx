Hi, I’m Farhan, a computer science student at RIT Bangalore. My interests lie in low-level programming, computer networks, and algorithm design and optimization.

Beyond coding, I like tinkering with Linux, or “ricing” as people call it these days. I’ve uploaded all my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Farhan291/dotfiles) on GitHub.

My current workflow runs on Fedora with Hyprland as the window compositor. I primarily use Neovim as my main IDE, along with the Kitty terminal, Fish shell, and tmux. I’m also a big fan of the Zen Browser.

In my free time, I enjoy watching anime and listening mostly to East Asian music, such as J-pop, K-pop, and C-pop. I also like playing visual novels.

If you’d like to get in touch, you can find the links in the footer.
